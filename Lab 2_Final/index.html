            <center><h4>National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Listings began in 1966 after the establishment of the National Historic Preservation
            Act, which helps protect and preserve important historic properties. Factors
            involved in listing a property include:</h4><h4><b>1.)</b><em> A desire to protect a resource,</em> <b>2.)</b><em> Proper
            justification,</em> and <b>3.)</b><em> Concurrence from the State Historic Preservation Office.</em></h4></center>

            <center><h4>NRHP eligibility determinations require an assessment of historic / prehistoric resources in relation to relevant
            historic contexts through criteria set forth in 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) § 60. The criteria (36 CFR §
            60.4) are used to evaluate resources when complying with the NHPA. Those criteria state that eligible
            resources comprise “districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
            setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association,” and any of the following criteria:</h4></center>
            
            <center><h4><p><b>A.)</b><em> that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our
            history,</em></p><p><b>B.)</b><em> that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past,</em></p>
            <p><b>C.)</b><em> that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that represent
            the work of a master, or that possess high artistic value, or that represent a significant and distinguishable
            entity whose components may lack individual distinction,</em></p>
            <p><b>D.)</b><em> that has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.</em></p></h4></center>

            <center><h4>In addition to the above criteria, Historical / Cultural Resources eligible for listing must also be at least 50
            years old, and have significance under a historical theme such as Economic Development of the Early
            20th Century. A resource can also qualify for listing if it is the first or last of its kind, or is unique like the
            architecture in Science Hall at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.</h4></center>

            <center><h4>The rise in NRHP listings during the 1970s and 1980s was primariliy due to
            economic benefits like rehabilitation tax credits for property owners. Many people sought NRHP status for their
            properties without understanding what stipulations accompanied the federal benefits. By the 1990s, this misunderstanding 
            of the regulations resulted in a widespread belief that NRHP listing automatically restricted what people could do with their properties. 
            Some people even mistakenly believed that NRHP listing meant a property had to be open to the public. By the 21st century, knowledge of the
            NRHP had more than 30 years to disseminate to every county; therefore, a general stabilization was expected rather than an overall decline. 
            Although not the only contributor to the overall decline in NRHP listings, the lack of understanding NRHP regulations
            was one of the primary causes.</h4></center>
